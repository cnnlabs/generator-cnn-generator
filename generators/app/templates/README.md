# <%= PACKAGE_NAME %>

## Requirements

A current LTS or Stable version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).  We recommend
using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#readme) to manage node versions.

A utility for installing [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) packages.  `yo`, that comes
with Yeoman, will work, but it is recommended you use the `cnn` CLI available
from [CNN Package Generator](https://github.com/cnnlabs/cnn-package-generator#readme).


## Install

This is not needed if you are using the `cnn` CLI.

```shell
$ npm install --global <%= PACKAGE_NAME %>
```


## Usage

With `cnn` (**recommended**):
- See the [README](https://github.com/cnnlabs/cnn-package-generator#readme) in
  the CNN Package Generator repo for usage details on the `cnn` CLI.

With `yo`:
- `$ yo <%= GENERATOR_NAME %>`
